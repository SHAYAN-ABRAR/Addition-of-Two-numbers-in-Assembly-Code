# Assembly Program: Addition of Two Numbers

## Overview
This Assembly Language program takes two **single-digit** numbers as input from the user, adds them, and displays the result. The program runs in **8086 DOS environment** using **MASM**.

## Features
- Accepts two **single-digit** numbers from the user.
- Converts ASCII input to numeric values.
- Performs addition and converts the result back to ASCII.
- Displays the sum with a descriptive message.
- Uses DOS interrupts (INT 21h) for input/output operations.

## How It Works
1. **Prompts the user** to enter the first number.
2. **Takes input, converts it from ASCII to integer, and stores it.**
3. **Repeats the process for the second number.**
4. **Performs addition** and converts the result back to ASCII.
5. **Displays the sum** with a message.
